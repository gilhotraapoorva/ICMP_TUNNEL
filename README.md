# ICMP_TUNNEL
The "ICMP Tunnel Data Transfer" project enables secure and covert data transfer between a client and server using the ICMP protocol. The client sends the name of a file containing data to the server. The server reads the file, divides it into ICMP packets, and sends them back as responses to the client. The client receives the packets and appends the data to the file. This tunneling technique allows discreet communication over ICMP packets, ideal for scenarios where conventional channels may be blocked. The project ensures efficient, encrypted, and reliable data exchange between connected machines, facilitating covert communication with a minimal network footprint.
